# Common Terminal Commands

## Manual Command



If you are on Windows and using Git Bash, the `man` command is not included, however, you can just type the command that you want to know more about and then `--help` and you will get similar info:

```bash
  ls --help
```

You should be able to use the arrow keys or page up and down. When you are ready to exit, just press `q`.


## File System Navigation

Commands to navigate your file system are very important. You will be using them all the time. You won't remember every single command that you use, but these are the ones that you should remember.

| Command                             | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pwd                                 | Lists the path to the working directory                                           |
| ls                                  | List directory contents                                                           |
| ls -a                               | List contents including hidden files (Files that begin with a dot)                |
| ls -l                               | List contents with more info including permissions (long listing)                 |
| ls -r                               | List contents reverse order                                                       |
| cd                                  | Change directory to home                                                          |
| cd [dirname]                        | Change directory to specific directory                                            |
| cd ~                                | Change to home directory                                                          |
| cd ..                               | Change to parent directory                                                        |
| cd -                                | Change to previous directory (which could be different than the parent of course) |
| find [dirtosearch] -name [filename] | Find location of a program                                                        |

Of course, you can group flags together. For example, if I want to see more info and view hidden files, I could do `ls -l -a` and even shorten it to `ls -la`.

## Opening a Folder or File

If you want to open a file or a folder in the GUI from your terminal, the command is different depending on the OS.

Mac - `open [dirname]`
Windows - `start [dirname]`
Linux - `xdg-open [dirname]`

You can open folders, files and even URLs

```bash
  open https://traversymedia.com
```

## Modifying Files & Directories

| Command                     | Description                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| mkdir [dirname]             | Make directory                                      |
| touch [filename]            | Create file                                         |
| rm [filename]               | Remove file                                         |
| rm -i [filename]            | Remove directory, but ask before                    |
| rm -r [dirname]             | Remove directory                                    |
| rm -rf [dirname]            | Remove directory with contents                      |
| rm ./\*                     | Remove everything in the current folder             |
| cp [filename] [dirname]     | Copy file                                           |
| mv [filename] [dirname]     | Move file                                           |
| mv [dirname] [dirname]      | Move directory                                      |
| mv [filename] [filename]    | Rename file or folder                               |
| mv [filename] [filename] -v | Rename Verbose - print source/destination directory |

We can also do multiple commands at once with the `&&` operator:

```bash
cd test2 && mkdir test3
```

## The `cat` (concatenate) Command

The cat command is a very common command and allows you to create single or multiple files, view content of a file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.

The most common thing I use it for is to display the contents of a file:

```bash
  cat [filename]
```

You can also create a file using the `cat` command:

```bash
  cat > [filename]
```

This will open up a new file and you can start typing. When you are done, you can press `Ctrl + D` to save and exit.

You can also append to a file:

```bash
  cat >> [filename]
```

## The `echo` Command

The `echo` command is used to display messages, or to create and write to files. It is similar to the `cat` command, but it is used to display a single line of text.

```bash
  echo "Hello World"
```

You can also use it to create a file:

```bash
  echo "Hello World" > [filename]
```

You can also append to a file:

```bash
  echo "Hello World" >> [filename]
```

## Piping
Piping is very powerful. It is a way of redirecting standard output to another destination, such as another file. Let's actually use the find command to find a list of files and then pipe them to a new file.

First, we'll create 10 files:

```bash
touch file-{001..010}.txt
```

Now, let's pipe the result from our find into a new file named `output.txt`

```bash
find . -name "file-0*" > output.txt
```

You can see the results now in the new file:

```bash
cat output.txt
```
